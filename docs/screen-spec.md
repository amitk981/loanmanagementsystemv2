## 2. Purpose of This Screen Specification

This document defines the required screens, page structures, fields, user actions, validations, state behaviours, role permissions and system outputs for a digital system that implements the SFPCL Member Credit Administration and Settlement SOP.

The screen specification converts the process into practical product screens that can be designed and built. It is intentionally detailed so that a product, design or engineering team can understand how the operational SOP should appear and behave in a working application.

The screens described here must support the following full lifecycle:

1. Policy and reference data configuration.
2. Member and borrower identification.
3. Initial loan request.
4. Application completeness checking.
5. KYC and supporting document capture.
6. Active member validation.
7. Loan eligibility assessment.
8. Loan limit calculation.
9. Loan appraisal note preparation.
10. Credit Manager review.
11. Sanction Committee scrutiny.
12. Approval, rejection and exception handling.
13. Special case handling for director / Sanction Committee member / relative borrower.
14. Documentation and stamping.
15. Security document handling, including SH-4 and CDSL pledge.
16. SAP customer code creation request.
17. Loan disbursement initiation and authorisation.
18. Loan account creation and monitoring.
19. Direct repayment and subsidiary-based repayment.
20. Interest accrual, invoicing and capitalisation.
21. DPD monitoring and CFO MIS.
22. Default management, extension and recovery action.
23. Closure, NOC, unpledge and security return.
24. Compliance dashboards, registers and audit trail.

## 3. Product Scope Reflected in Screens

The screen set covers all major modules required by the SOP:

| Module | Included Screens |
|---|---|
| Dashboard and Work Queues | Role-based dashboard, global search, tasks, alerts and exception queues |
| Member and Borrower Master | Member directory, member profile, borrower 360, nominee, witness, shareholding, land and crop records |
| Loan Origination | New application, application detail, completeness check, deficiency and rejection handling |
| Eligibility and Appraisal | Active member validation, KYC verification, loan limit calculator, appraisal note |
| Sanction | Credit Manager review, Sanction Committee workbench, sanction decision, special approvals |
| Documentation | Document checklist, PoA, tri-party agreement, SH-4, CDSL pledge, term sheet, loan agreement, bank verification letter |
| SAP and Finance Setup | SAP customer code request, customer code confirmation, finance readiness |
| Disbursement | Disbursement initiation, Senior Manager Finance verification, Chief Financial Controller authorisation, disbursement advice |
| Loan Account | Loan account 360, repayment schedule, ledger, statements, outstanding balance |
| Repayment | Direct RTGS / NEFT receipt, subsidiary deduction reconciliation, principal-first allocation |
| Interest | Interest accrual, yearly invoices, unpaid interest capitalisation after 30 April |
| Monitoring | DPD dashboard, quarterly CFO MIS, reminders, ageing reports |

| Administration | Policy settings, user roles, approval matrix, templates, audit logs |

## 3.2 Out of Scope Unless Separately Confirmed

The following are not fully defined by the SOP and should be shown as configurable or pending client confirmation:

1. Exact interest benchmark, spread, reset frequency and APR disclosure method.
2. Penal interest rate and fee values.
3. Whether credit bureau checks are mandatory.
4. Whether NACH / ECS mandate is operationally required.
5. Guarantor rules and thresholds.
6. Automated integration with SAP, RBL Bank or CDSL. The base screen spec assumes workflow tracking and document capture; API integration may be added later.
7. Mobile app borrower self-service unless separately prioritised. This spec assumes an internal web application with optional borrower-facing digital intake.
8. Automated e-stamping or notarisation integration.
9. Full legal case management after recovery action.
10. External regulator filing workflows beyond internal compliance tracking.

---

## 4. Design Principles for All Screens

## 4.1 Lifecycle-First Design

Every loan record should be organised around its lifecycle stage. Users should always be able to see where the loan currently is, what has already happened, what is pending and who owns the next action.

Recommended stage stepper:

```text
Application -> Completeness -> Appraisal -> Sanction -> Documentation -> SAP Setup -> Disbursement -> Active Loan -> Monitoring -> Closure
```

For defaulted loans, an additional overlay state should appear:

```text
Normal -> Overdue -> Grace Period -> Extension -> Non-Payment Review -> Recovery Action -> Closed / Written Off / Resolved
```

## 4.2 Control Gates Must Be Visible

The SOP has strict controls. Screens must not hide these controls. A user should see explicit blockers such as:

- Non-member applicant.
- Inactive member.
- Missing PAN / Aadhaar.
- Missing nominee signature.
- Minor nominee.
- Missing 7/12 extract.
- Missing crop plan.
- Missing six-month bank statement.
- Loan purpose not agriculture / crop production.
- Requested amount exceeding eligible limit.
- Documentation not stamped.
- Loan Agreement not notarised.
- SH-4 missing for physical shares.
- CDSL pledge incomplete for demat shares.
- SAP customer code not created.
- Bank account not verified.
- Sanction approval missing.
- Special case approval missing.

## 4.3 Registers Should Be Generated Views

The SOP refers to several registers. In the digital system, these should be structured views generated from underlying records, not separately maintained duplicate spreadsheets.

Registers include:

- Loan Request Register.
- Credit Sanction Register.
- Exception Register.
- Security Register.
- Stamp Duty Register.
- KYC / CKYC Register.
- Grievance Register.
- Recovery Log.
- Archive Register.

## 4.4 One Source of Truth Per Loan

Every screen should connect back to a single Loan Application ID and Loan Account ID.

Key identifiers:

| Identifier | Description |
|---|---|
| Application Reference Number | Starts at `LO00000001` and increments sequentially. Assigned after completeness check. |
| Member ID / Folio Number | Identifies the shareholder / member. |
| SAP Customer Code | Created or confirmed before disbursement. |
| Loan Account Number | Created after disbursement. May be same as or derived from Application Reference Number. |
| Security Reference | SH-4 reference or CDSL Pledge Sequence Number. |

## 4.5 Role-Specific Workspaces

Screens should show only the tasks relevant to the logged-in role, while still allowing authorised users to see the overall loan context.

Role examples:

- Deputy Manager - Finance: application completeness and appraisal preparation.
- Credit Manager: review, rejection, appraisal finalisation, loan register, repayment monitoring.
- Company Secretary: documentation, stamping, PoA, SH-4, compliance evidence.
- Compliance Team Member: document preparation and checklist management.
- Sanction Committee: sanction decisions and exception approvals.
- CFO: approvals, MIS, statutory compliance monitoring.
- Senior Manager - Finance: SAP request, disbursement verification and payment initiation.
- Chief Financial Controller: final bank transfer approval.
- Accounts Team: repayment entries, accruals, invoices and DPD reports.
- Internal Auditor: read-only access to complete audit trails and documents.

## 5. Global Screen Components

# 15. Final Product Interpretation

The screen design should make the SOP operationally enforceable. The system should not simply store loan data; it should actively guide users through the required sequence, prevent bypassing mandatory gates and preserve evidence for audit.

The most important product behaviours are:

1. Clear status visibility at every stage.
2. Strong document and signature controls.
3. Automated loan limit calculations with exception routing.
4. Approval matrix enforcement.
5. Separation of maker, checker, sanction and disbursement roles.
6. SAP and bank process traceability.
7. Repayment and interest accounting visibility.
8. Default handling discipline.
9. Closure evidence, including NOC and security return.
10. Compliance reporting and long-term audit readiness.

The resulting system should replace fragmented Excel, email, paper checklist and manual follow-up processes with a structured workflow in which every application, approval, document, transaction and exception is traceable from the first loan inquiry through final archival.
